<h3>Translations</h3>

Weâ€™d really love to encourage and help share translations of the jargon glossary to the global WordPress community. If you have a translation to contribute, please add it to the WordPress GitHub repo so others can benefit, too. Pull requests welcome!

To translate the jargon glossary, please create a sub-directory of the project under Working Translations, giving it the correct ISO639 code (for example, fr for French), and submit a pull request. Once the translation has reached a release / first full translation, we'll move it to its own subdirectory at the top level, and subsequent updates will happen in that location.
